### TODO:

- ### Critical

  - MOVE SCREEN RIGHT AND LEFT --> needs to record user pos and subtract it from edge pos. --> Update user pos with mouse movement.
  - ZOOM IN AND ZOOM OUT --> weirder, maybe change both circle values and positions? Some transformation.
- ### Backlog

  - Antialiasing lines.
  - Understand everything.
